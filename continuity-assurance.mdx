# What if Cortex shuts down?

Cortex plays a critical role in our customers' technology infrastructure, often serving as the foundation of their operations. We fully recognize concerns regarding Cortex's longevity and are addressing them in the following ways:

## Continuity Assurance

For certain clients, we have made contractual commitments to deploy Cortex within their infrastructure in the unlikely event of a shutdown, ensuring continuous service and access to the intellectual property as required.

## Customer Base and Longevity

Our stability is reinforced by our expanding customer base. We're proud to support incredible companies, from emerging startups to established enterprises. Their trust not only solidifies Cortex but also enhances its value for our broader ecosystem.

## Flexible Deployment Options

Cortex offers various deployment choices to best suit your needs:

**Cortex Cloud**: Hosted by us, ensuring ease of use and reliability.

**Cortex On-premises**: Hosted by you, with infrastructure management provided by us for optimal performance.

**Cortex Self-hosted**: This option allows you to fully host and manage the solution, giving you the utmost control. Additionally, we offer access to Cortex's source code, empowering your engineering team to build upon and customize our foundational technology according to your specific needs.

## Open-Source Commitment

**Why not open-source now?** Our pre-built AI search models demand significant time and attention to detail. Open-sourcing would require us to broadly distribute our intellectual property, and dedicate resources to building and managing a community â€” resources we wish to allocate judiciously. Maintaining our competitive advantage in creating superior AI search capabilities is also paramount.

**Staying true to the open-source movement**: We believe that partially open-sourcing our product merely to label ourselves as 'open-source' contradicts the core principles of the open-source community. We are strong believers in the open-source movement and understand the importance of contributing to it with a perspective that extends beyond mere nomenclature.

If you have suggestions on what approach you think works great for core infrastructure products like Cortex, we're all ears. Please write to us at [support@useCortex.com](mailto:support@useCortex.com)
