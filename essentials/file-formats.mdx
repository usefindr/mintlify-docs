Cortex supports a comprehensive range of file formats for document processing. Files are automatically parsed and their content extracted for indexing and search. This page provides a complete reference of all supported formats.

<Warning>
**Unsupported File Formats**: If you attempt to upload a file format that is not supported, you will receive an error response with status code `400` and the message: `"Unsupported file format: [filename]. Please check our supported file formats documentation."` Ensure your files are in one of the supported formats listed below before uploading.

- **ANSI-formatted text**

## File Size and Processing Limits

### **File Size Limits**
- **Maximum file size**: 50MB per file
- **Recommended size**: Under 10MB for optimal processing speed
- **Large files**: Files over 100 pages may take longer to process

### **Processing Time**
Cortex is optimized for speed and typically processes files much faster than traditional solutions:

- **Small files** (< 10 pages): **Under 2 minutes** (typically 30 seconds to 1 minute)
- **Medium files** (10-100 pages): **2-5 minutes** (typically 1-3 minutes)
- **Large files** (100+ pages): **5-15 minutes** (typically 3-8 minutes)

<Note>
**Performance Note**: Cortex's processing times are significantly faster than traditional document processing solutions. Most files under 10 pages are processed in under 2 minutes, with many completing in under 1 minute.
</Note>

## Best Practices

### **File Preparation**
- Ensure files are not password-protected
- Use clear, well-structured documents for better parsing
- Avoid corrupted or damaged files
- Use descriptive filenames for easier identification

### **Format-Specific Tips**

**PDF Files:**
- Use text-based PDFs rather than scanned images when possible
- Ensure proper text encoding (UTF-8 preferred)
- Avoid password-protected or encrypted PDFs

**Office Documents:**
- Save in the latest format version when possible
- Remove unnecessary formatting that might interfere with parsing
- Ensure all content is accessible (not hidden or in comments only)

**Images:**
- Use high-resolution images with clear, readable text
- Ensure good contrast between text and background
- Avoid heavily stylized fonts that might be difficult to OCR

**Markdown:**
- Use standard Markdown syntax for best compatibility
- Include proper heading structure for better chunking
- Use consistent formatting throughout the document

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**File Not Processing:**
- Check if the file format is supported (see list above)
- Verify the file is not corrupted or password-protected
- Ensure the file size is under 50MB
- Check your API key permissions

**Poor Text Extraction:**
- For images: ensure high resolution and clear text
- For PDFs: use text-based rather than scanned PDFs
- For office docs: avoid complex formatting or embedded objects

**Processing Errors:**
- Check the file format against the supported list
- Verify file integrity (not corrupted)
- Ensure proper file permissions
- Contact support with the `file_id` if issues persist
