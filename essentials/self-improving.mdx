## Self-Improving Personalization (AI Memories)

**What it is:**  
Cortex includes memory that improves over time. The system learns how individual users behaveâ€”what formats they prefer (e.g. tables, summaries), what content types they favor (e.g. spreadsheets, slides), and how they usually ask questions. It watches both their inputs and the AI's past responses to get smarter.

**Benefit:**  
It makes every interaction feel more personal. Responses start to feel tailored instead of generic, which drives higher engagement, better results, and user delight. Over time, this builds a sticky, habit-forming experience that keeps users coming back.

**Use Case & Scenario:**  
Let's say you're building a knowledge assistant for a sales team. Alex, a rep, prefers answers in bullet points and always looks for XLSX files. The AI starts recognizing this and automatically responds in bullet points while prioritizing spreadsheet sources. It's like the assistant knows Alex personally.
