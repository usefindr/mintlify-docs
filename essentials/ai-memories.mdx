title: "AI Memories"
description: "Store, retrieve, and personalize user experiences with dynamic AI memories that evolve over time, enabling your app to remember preferences, context, and past interactions for smarter, more adaptive responses."

Cortex's AI Memories feature lets your application remember what matters. Unlike static knowledge, AI memories are dynamic, user-specific, and continuously updated as users interact with your app. This means your AI can recall preferences, past actions, and contextual signals—enabling truly personalized, adaptive experiences that get smarter with every use.

## What are AI Memories?

AI memories are personal, contextual information stored for individual users that help your AI system:
- **Remember user preferences** and past interactions
- **Provide personalized responses** based on user history  
- **Enhance user experience** through adaptive behavior

Think of AI memories as a "second brain" for each user—a continuously evolving profile that captures not just what users say, but what they mean, their intentions, and their unique behaviors.

## Key Benefits

With AI memories, every interaction feels personal. The system:
- **Tailors responses** to individual user preferences
- **Anticipates needs** based on past behavior
- **Adapts to changing preferences** over time
- **Drives higher engagement** through personalized experiences
- **Creates a sense of connection** where the AI truly "knows" the user

## How It Works

### 1. Memory Creation
Memories can be created in two ways:
- **Manual Addition**: Explicitly add specific memories using the [Add User Memory](/api-reference/endpoint/add-user-memory) endpoint
- **Automatic Generation**: Use the [Generate User Memory](/api-reference/endpoint/generate-user-memory) endpoint to automatically create multiple memories from user queries or conversations

### 2. Memory Storage
All memories are stored in a vector database that enables:
- **Semantic search** to find relevant memories
- **Contextual retrieval** based on meaning, not just keywords
- **Tenant isolation** to ensure data privacy and security

### 3. Memory Retrieval
Use the [Retrieve User Memory](/api-reference/endpoint/retrieve-user-memory) endpoint to:
- **Find relevant context** before generating AI responses
- **Access user preferences** for personalized interactions

### 4. Memory Management
- **List all memories** using the [List User Memories](/api-reference/endpoint/list-user-memories) endpoint
- **Remove outdated memories** with the [Delete User Memory](/api-reference/endpoint/delete-user-memory) endpoint
- **Maintain data quality** through regular memory audits

## Tenant Provisioning

<Warning>
**Important**: If you receive an error stating "Tenant-id/sub-tenant-id combination either does not exist or is not provisioned for user memory", this means the tenant/sub-tenant combination hasn't been set up for user memory functionality yet.
</Warning>

**Automatic Provisioning**: The tenant/sub-tenant combination will be automatically provisioned for user memory when you add or generate your first user memory for that combination. No manual setup is required.

## Use Cases & Scenarios

### Sales Assistant
Imagine a sales assistant that remembers each rep's preferred answer format and the types of files they use most. Over time, the AI starts responding in the rep's favorite style and prioritizes relevant content, making every interaction faster and more effective.

### Customer Support
A support system that remembers each customer's technical expertise level, preferred communication style, and past issues. This enables the AI to provide appropriately detailed responses and avoid repeating previously solved problems.

### Learning Platform
An educational platform that tracks each student's learning progress, preferred learning styles, and areas of difficulty. The AI can then adapt content delivery and provide personalized study recommendations.

### Project Management
A project management tool that remembers each team member's role, expertise areas, and communication preferences. This helps the AI provide relevant updates and suggestions tailored to each person's needs.

## Getting Started

1. **Add your first memory** using the [Add User Memory](/api-reference/endpoint/add-user-memory) endpoint
2. **Generate memories from conversations** using the [Generate User Memory](/api-reference/endpoint/generate-user-memory) endpoint  
3. **Retrieve relevant context** using the [Retrieve User Memory](/api-reference/endpoint/retrieve-user-memory) endpoint
4. **Manage your memory profile** using the [List User Memories](/api-reference/endpoint/list-user-memories) and [Delete User Memory](/api-reference/endpoint/delete-user-memory) endpoints

## Best Practices

- **Use descriptive memory content** that will be useful for future AI interactions
- **Consider the context** in which memories will be retrieved
- **Avoid storing sensitive information** unless necessary
- **Use consistent formatting** for similar types of memories
- **Regularly review and clean up** outdated memories
- **Provide users with control** over their memory data
