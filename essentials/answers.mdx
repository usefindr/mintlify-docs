## Personalized Response Styles

Cortex doesn't just answer — it learns how *you* like your answers.

Over time, the system adapts to each user's preferences by observing their behavior, past queries, and feedback loops. This includes:

- Preferred **formats** (e.g. tables, bullet points, summaries)
- Preferred **tone** (e.g. concise, friendly, formal)
- Preferred **depth** (e.g. quick summary vs detailed explanation)
- Specific **content types** (e.g. Excel files, slide decks, contracts)

You can also allow users to explicitly specify how they want answers — for example:

```json
"I prefer comparisons in a markdown table."
"I like summaries with bullets, not long paragraphs."
```

This creates a highly tailored experience where answers feel personalized, not generic.

## Smart Clarifications

When users ask vague or ambiguous questions, Cortex's intelligent search agent recognizes this and **asks for clarification** instead of performing a poor-quality search.

Rather than returning irrelevant or incomplete results from unclear queries, and just plain ChatGPT answers, the system:

- **Detects ambiguous language** in user questions
- **Identifies missing context** that would improve search quality
- **Generates targeted clarification questions** to gather more specific information
- **Waits for user input** before proceeding with the search

This happens automatically when the AI determines a query is too broad, unclear, or lacks sufficient context to provide meaningful results.

Example interaction:

```json
{
  "question": "Tell me about the contract",
  "response": {
    "clarification_needed": true,
    "clarification_question": "I found several contracts in your documents. Could you specify which contract you're interested in, or what specific aspect you'd like to know about (e.g., terms, pricing, termination clauses)?"
  }
}
```

You can use these clarification questions in your frontend to **prompt users for more details**, ensuring they get high-quality, relevant answers rather than generic responses. This creates a more conversational experience and significantly improves result accuracy.

## Grounded with Citations

Every response can be **grounded in source material** using Cortex's built-in citation system.

When a user asks a question, the answer is generated using documents, web data, or memory — and the system:

- Returns the **exact chunks** of source text used to build the answer
- Provides **source IDs, titles, page numbers**, and optionally **bounding box coordinates** for PDFs
- Allows the frontend to show inline citations, source previews, or even highlight regions in original files

Example output:

```json
{
  "answer": "The contract allows termination with a 30-day notice after 12 months.",
  "sources": [
    {
      "source_id": "doc-123",
      "title": "contract.pdf",
      "page": 3
    }
  ],
  "chunks": [
    {
      "text": "The contract specifies a 12-month term...",
      "bounding_box": {
        "x": 120, "y": 320, "width": 180, "height": 40
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This keeps responses **auditable, explainable, and trustworthy** — especially useful in enterprise, legal, and compliance settings.

---

## Filter by Metadata

{/* You can restrict the context used for answering questions by providing `tenant_metadata` and `document_metadata` parameters in upload API calls. This allows you to filter sources by `source_title` or `source_type`.

```json
"tenant_metadata": {"source_title": "contract.pdf"},
{/* "document_metadata": {"source_title": "contract.pdf"} */}
``` */}

Only sources matching the provided metadata will be used for context.

---

## Creative Mode

Sometimes, users want answers that go beyond their knowledge base. Creative mode allows your app to let LLMs generate responses without **solely** relying on the retrieved context. It's like interfacing directly with ChatGPT.

With `creative_mode` enabled, Cortex shifts from strictly grounded retrieval to **imaginative generation**, allowing it to:

- Suggest new ideas or concepts
- Generate content beyond the original sources
- Expand on partial context using LLM capabilities

Use this when you want the AI to help with:

- Brainstorming things outside of the context
- Writing summaries with flair
- Exploring hypothetical ideas
- Rewriting answers for tone and creativity

You can toggle this mode using the `search_mode: ["creative"]` parameter in the `/search/qna` API call.

```json
{
  "question": "Give me 5 fun blog title ideas about data privacy",
  "search_mode": ["creative"]
}
```

## Combine All Modes

Cortex's strength is in combining these capabilities into one flexible response system:

- **Retrieval + Generation:** Factual answers grounded in sources
- **Memory + Personalization:** Responses that evolve to match each user
- **Creativity + Control:** Creative responses when needed, factual when not

Whether you're building a research assistant, support bot, or content co-pilot — Cortex helps your AI speak with intelligence *and* personality.
