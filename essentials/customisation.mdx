 They can set preferences like: format (tables, bullets), tone (friendly, concise), depth (summary vs deep dive), or structure (comparison vs explanation).

## What it is

Customization allows users to control how AI responds to their queries by setting personal preferences. This includes choosing response formats (tables, lists, paragraphs), communication tone (professional, casual, technical), detail level (brief summaries or comprehensive analysis), and structural preferences (comparative analysis, step-by-step guides, or explanatory content).

## Benefit

Responses feel truly personalized, and users are more satisfied. Instead of forcing one answer style on everyone, you give each person control.

## Use Case & Scenario

A product manager says, "Compare these three tools in a table format with feature highlights only." The AI replies with a clean, markdown-style table showing the differences. No need for rephrasing or manual formatting.
