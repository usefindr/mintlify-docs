## AI Web Search

**What it is:**  
If your data doesn't contain the answer or if a user wants real-time information, Cortex can search the internet and bring back relevant context from trusted sites. You can use this for current events, regulations, trends, or anything your internal knowledge base doesn't cover.

**Benefit:**  
Answers are never outdated. Your AI can stay relevant with real-time information, making it smarter than static bots and more helpful in research-heavy workflows.

**Use Case & Scenario:**  
You're building an AI assistant for financial analysts. A user asks, "What's the latest ruling from the SEC about crypto ETFs?" The AI searches financial news sites and regulatory databases, returning the most up-to-date summaries and links.
