> **Status**: This guide is in progress.

This guide demonstrates how to build a revolutionary AI-powered hiring platform that transforms how recruiters and hiring managers discover candidates. Instead of traditional keyword searches, your platform will understand natural language queries and provide intelligent candidate matching using Cortex's advanced AI capabilities.

Note: All code examples in this guide are for demonstration purposes. They show the concepts and patterns you can use when building your own Glean-like application with Cortex APIs. Follow the actual API documentation to adapt these examples to your specific use case, technology stack, and requirements.

## The Problem with Traditional Hiring Platforms

Traditional hiring platforms force recruiters to think like databases:

- **Keyword matching**: "Machine Learning OR Apple OR 5 years"
- **Boolean operators**: Complex filter combinations
- **Manual screening**: Hours spent reviewing irrelevant profiles
- **Missed candidates**: Great candidates who don't match exact keywords

## The AI-Powered Solution

With Cortex, recruiters can search naturally:

- **"Find me someone who has 5\+ years of experience in machine learning and has worked at Apple before"**
- **"I need a senior frontend developer who has experience scaling React applications at a startup"**
- **"Show me candidates who transitioned from consulting to product management at a tech company"**
- **"Fetch the essays for the candidates that have gone to Harvard for their masters in computer science"**

};
```

## Step 2: Natural Language Search Implementation

### Understanding Query Intent

The power of AI search lies in understanding what recruiters really mean:

#### Query Types and Patterns

```javascript
const queryPatterns = {
  // Experience-based queries
  experience_queries: [
    "Find me someone who has 5+ years of experience in machine learning",
    "I need a developer with at least 3 years of React experience",
    "Show me candidates who have worked with startups for more than 2 years"
  ],
  
  // Company-based queries
  company_queries: [
    "Find candidates who worked at Apple, Google, or Microsoft",
    "Show me people who have startup experience",
    "I want someone who has worked at a Series B startup"
  ],
  
  // Skill combination queries
  skill_combination_queries: [
    "Find a full-stack developer who knows React and Node.js",
    "I need someone with ML experience and strong Python skills",
    "Show me candidates with both technical and management experience"
  ],
  
  // Transition queries
  transition_queries: [
    "Find candidates who moved from consulting to product management",
    "Show me developers who transitioned into machine learning",
    "I need someone who went from startup to big tech"
  ],
  
  // Cultural fit queries
  cultural_fit_queries: [
    "Find candidates who thrive in fast-paced environments",
    "Show me people who have built teams from scratch",
    "I need someone who has experience with remote-first companies"
  ]
};
```

### Implementing Cortex Search for Hiring

```javascript
class AIRecruitingSearch {
  constructor(apiKey, tenantId) {
    this.apiKey = apiKey;
    this.tenantId = tenantId;
    this.baseUrl = 'https://api.usecortex.ai';
  }

  async findCandidates(query, recruiterContext = {}) {
    const searchPayload = {
      question: query,
      session_id: recruiterContext.sessionId || this.generateSessionId(),
      tenant_id: this.tenantId,
      user_name: recruiterContext.recruiterId, // Enables AI memories
      
      // Hiring-specific configurations
      top_n: 20, // More candidates for review
      search_modes: ['creative', 'precise'], // Multiple search approaches
      multi_step_reasoning: true, // Break down complex requirements
      auto_agent_routing: true, // Route to specialized hiring agent
      
      // Search tuning for candidate discovery
      search_alpha: 0.6, // Favor semantic understanding
      recency_bias: 0.2, // Don't heavily favor recent profiles
      
      // Hiring-specific instructions
      user_instructions: this.buildHiringInstructions(recruiterContext),
      
      // Metadata filtering if needed
      metadata: this.buildMetadataFilter(recruiterContext)
    };

    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/search/qna`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.apiKey}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(searchPayload)
    });

    const results = await response.json();
    return this.enhanceCandidateResults(results, query);
  }

  buildHiringInstructions(recruiterContext) {
    let instructions = `You are helping a recruiter find the best candidates. `;
    
    if (recruiterContext.role) {
      instructions += `They are looking to fill a ${recruiterContext.role} position. `;
    }
    
    if (recruiterContext.company) {
      instructions += `The role is at ${recruiterContext.company}. `;
    }
    
    if (recruiterContext.teamSize) {
      instructions += `The team size is ${recruiterContext.teamSize}. `;
    }
    
    instructions += `Focus on candidate fit, experience relevance, and potential for success. 
                    Highlight why each candidate would be a good match. 
                    Consider both hard skills and soft skills. 
                    Rank candidates by overall fit for the role.`;
    
    return instructions;
  }

  enhanceCandidateResults(results, originalQuery) {
    if (!results.sources) return results;
    
    // Add hiring-specific analysis to each candidate
    const enhancedSources = results.sources.map(candidate => ({
      ...candidate,
      fit_score: this.calculateFitScore(candidate, originalQuery),
      strengths: this.extractStrengths(candidate),
      potential_concerns: this.extractConcerns(candidate),
      interview_questions: this.suggestInterviewQuestions(candidate, originalQuery)
    }));

    // Sort by fit score
    enhancedSources.sort((a, b) => b.fit_score - a.fit_score);

    return {
      ...results,
      sources: enhancedSources,
      search_insights: this.generateSearchInsights(enhancedSources, originalQuery)
    };
  }

  calculateFitScore(candidate, query) {
    // Simple scoring algorithm - in practice, you'd use more sophisticated ML
    let score = 0;
    
    // Experience relevance
    if (candidate.metadata?.total_years_experience) {
      const years = candidate.metadata.total_years_experience;
      if (query.includes('5+') && years >= 5) score += 30;
      if (query.includes('3+') && years >= 3) score += 25;
      if (query.includes('senior') && years >= 5) score += 20;
    }
    
    // Company match
    const queryLower = query.toLowerCase();
    if (candidate.metadata?.companies) {
      candidate.metadata.companies.forEach(company => {
        if (queryLower.includes(company.name.toLowerCase())) {
          score += 25;
        }
      });
    }
    
    // Skill relevance (simplified)
    if (candidate.metadata?.primary_skills) {
      const skills = candidate.metadata.primary_skills;
      if (queryLower.includes('machine learning') && skills.includes('machine_learning')) {
        score += 20;
      }
    }
    
    return Math.min(score, 100); // Cap at 100
  }
}
```

## Step 3: AI Memories for Personalized Recruiting

### Understanding Recruiter Patterns

AI memories transform recruiting by learning each recruiter's preferences and patterns:

#### What AI Memories Capture

```javascript
const recruiterMemoryProfile = {
  // Search preferences
  search_patterns: {
    preferred_experience_levels: ['senior', 'staff'],
    frequently_searched_skills: ['react', 'nodejs', 'typescript'],
    preferred_company_types: ['startup', 'scale_up'],
    typical_salary_ranges: ['150k-250k'],
    location_preferences: ['san_francisco', 'remote']
  },
  
  // Successful hire patterns
  successful_hires: {
    common_backgrounds: ['apple', 'google', 'meta'],
    effective_skill_combinations: [
      ['react', 'nodejs', 'aws'],
      ['python', 'machine_learning', 'tensorflow']
    ],
    preferred_career_progressions: ['ic_to_senior_ic', 'startup_to_growth'],
    successful_education_backgrounds: ['computer_science', 'engineering']
  },
  
  // Team and role context
  hiring_context: {
    team_type: 'engineering',
    company_stage: 'series_b',
    team_size: 15,
    remote_policy: 'hybrid',
    common_interview_topics: ['system_design', 'coding', 'culture_fit']
  },
  
  // Communication preferences
  interaction_style: {
    detail_level: 'comprehensive', // brief, moderate, comprehensive
    preferred_format: 'structured_list',
    wants_interview_questions: true,
    wants_salary_insights: true
  }
};
```

### Implementing Personalized Search

```javascript
class PersonalizedRecruitingSearch extends AIRecruitingSearch {
  async searchWithPersonalization(query, recruiterId, jobContext = {}) {
    // AI memories are automatically managed by Cortex when we provide user_name
    const personalizedContext = {
      sessionId: await this.getRecruiterSessionId(recruiterId),
      recruiterId: recruiterId, // Enables automatic AI memory management
      ...jobContext
    };

    const results = await this.findCandidates(query, personalizedContext);
    
    // Add personalized insights based on recruiter's history
    return this.addPersonalizedInsights(results, recruiterId);
  }

  async addPersonalizedInsights(results, recruiterId) {
    // Get recruiter's AI memory context (managed automatically by Cortex)
    const recruiterProfile = await this.getRecruiterProfile(recruiterId);
    
    const personalizedResults = {
      ...results,
      personalized_insights: {
        recommended_candidates: this.getRecommendedCandidates(results.sources, recruiterProfile),
        similar_to_past_hires: this.findSimilarToPastHires(results.sources, recruiterProfile),
        interview_suggestions: this.generatePersonalizedInterviewQuestions(results.sources, recruiterProfile),
        salary_insights: this.generateSalaryInsights(results.sources, recruiterProfile)
      }
    };

    return personalizedResults;
  }

  getRecommendedCandidates(candidates, recruiterProfile) {
    return candidates
      .filter(candidate => {
        // Check if candidate matches recruiter's successful hire patterns
        const companies = candidate.metadata?.companies?.map(c => c.name.toLowerCase()) || [];
        const skills = candidate.metadata?.primary_skills || [];
        
        // Match against successful hire patterns
        const hasSuccessfulCompanyBackground = companies.some(company => 
          recruiterProfile.successful_hires?.common_backgrounds?.includes(company)
        );
        
        const hasPreferredSkills = skills.some(skill => 
          recruiterProfile.search_patterns?.frequently_searched_skills?.includes(skill)
        );
        
        return hasSuccessfulCompanyBackground || hasPreferredSkills;
      })
      .slice(0, 5); // Top 5 recommendations
  }

  generatePersonalizedInterviewQuestions(candidates, recruiterProfile) {
    const questions = [];
    
    candidates.slice(0, 3).forEach(candidate => {
      const candidateQuestions = [];
      
      // Generate questions based on candidate's experience
      if (candidate.metadata?.companies) {
        candidate.metadata.companies.forEach(company => {
          candidateQuestions.push(
            `Tell me about your experience at ${company.name} and how it relates to our ${recruiterProfile.hiring_context?.team_type} team.`
          );
        });
      }
      
      // Add technical questions based on recruiter's preferences
      if (recruiterProfile.hiring_context?.common_interview_topics?.includes('system_design')) {
        candidateQuestions.push(
          "Can you walk me through how you'd design a system to handle [specific use case relevant to the role]?"
        );
      }
      
      questions.push({
        candidate_name: candidate.title?.split(' - ')[1] || 'Candidate',
        candidate_id: candidate.source_id,
        suggested_questions: candidateQuestions
      });
    });
    
    return questions;
  }
}
```

### Example: AI Memory in Action

Here's how AI memories make recruiting more effective:

#### Initial Search (No Memory)

```
Recruiter Query: "Find me a senior React developer with startup experience"

Basic Results:
- 15 candidates with React experience
- Generic ranking by keyword match
- No context about recruiter preferences
```

#### After 10 Searches (AI Memory Active)

```
Recruiter Query: "Find me a senior React developer with startup experience"

AI-Enhanced Results:
- Prioritizes candidates from Series A/B startups (learned preference)
- Highlights candidates with Node.js experience (frequently paired skill)
- Suggests candidates with 4-6 years experience (recruiter's sweet spot)
- Includes salary expectations matching recruiter's budget
- Recommends candidates with remote experience (company is remote-first)

AI Memory Insights:
"Based on your previous successful hires, I'm highlighting candidates who:
- Have experience at high-growth startups like your previous hires from Stripe and Airbnb
- Combine React with Node.js and TypeScript (your most successful tech stack combination)
- Are in the 4-6 year experience range where you've had the highest offer acceptance rate"
```

## Step 4: Advanced Search Features

### Complex Query Understanding

Cortex excels at understanding complex, multi-faceted queries:

#### Multi-Criteria Searches

```javascript
const complexQueries = [
  {
    query: "Find me someone who has 5+ years of experience in machine learning and has worked at Apple before",
    breakdown: {
      experience_requirement: "5+ years",
      domain_requirement: "machine learning", 
      company_requirement: "Apple",
      additional_context: "Looking for proven ML expertise with big tech experience"
    }
  },
  
  {
    query: "I need a senior frontend developer who has experience scaling React applications at a startup and can lead a team",
    breakdown: {
      seniority: "senior",
      technical_skills: "React, frontend development",
      scaling_experience: "applications at scale",
      company_context: "startup",
      leadership_requirement: "team leadership"
    }
  },
  
  {
    query: "Show me candidates who transitioned from consulting to product management at a tech company and have an MBA",
    breakdown: {
      career_transition: "consulting → product management",
      industry_context: "tech company",
      education_requirement: "MBA",
      career_narrative: "Career switcher with business education"
    }
  }
];
```

### Metadata-Driven Filtering

Use metadata to handle precise requirements while maintaining natural language search:

```javascript
class AdvancedCandidateSearch extends PersonalizedRecruitingSearch {
  async searchWithComplexCriteria(query, criteria = {}) {
    const {
      experienceRange,
      requiredSkills,
      preferredCompanies,
      salaryRange,
      locationRequirements,
      educationLevel,
      availabilityStatus
    } = criteria;

    // Build metadata filter for hard requirements
    const metadataFilter = {};
    
    if (experienceRange) {
      metadataFilter.min_years_experience = experienceRange.min;
      metadataFilter.max_years_experience = experienceRange.max;
    }
    
    if (availabilityStatus) {
      metadataFilter.job_search_status = availabilityStatus;
    }

    // Use natural language query for soft requirements and context
    const enhancedQuery = this.enhanceQueryWithContext(query, criteria);

    const results = await this.findCandidates(enhancedQuery, {
      metadata: metadataFilter,
      userInstructions: this.buildAdvancedInstructions(criteria)
    });

    return this.rankByComplexCriteria(results, criteria);
  }

  enhanceQueryWithContext(originalQuery, criteria) {
    let enhancedQuery = originalQuery;
    
    if (criteria.teamContext) {
      enhancedQuery += ` for a ${criteria.teamContext.size}-person ${criteria.teamContext.type} team`;
    }
    
    if (criteria.companyContext) {
      enhancedQuery += ` at a ${criteria.companyContext.stage} ${criteria.companyContext.industry} company`;
    }
    
    if (criteria.urgency) {
      enhancedQuery += `. This is a ${criteria.urgency} priority hire`;
    }
    
    return enhancedQuery;
  }

  buildAdvancedInstructions(criteria) {
    let instructions = "Find candidates who best match these requirements:\n";
    
    if (criteria.mustHave) {
      instructions += `Must have: ${criteria.mustHave.join(', ')}\n`;
    }
    
    if (criteria.niceToHave) {
      instructions += `Nice to have: ${criteria.niceToHave.join(', ')}\n`;
    }
    
    if (criteria.dealBreakers) {
      instructions += `Avoid candidates with: ${criteria.dealBreakers.join(', ')}\n`;
    }
    
    instructions += "Rank candidates by overall fit, considering both technical skills and cultural alignment.";
    
    return instructions;
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Intelligent Candidate Matching

### Semantic Understanding vs. Keyword Matching

Traditional platforms rely on exact keyword matches. AI search understands concepts and relationships:
