title: "Upload App Sources"
openapi: "POST /upload/upload_app_sources"
description: "Specifically built to handle knowledge from workplace apps. Parsing, chunking, and indexing depends on the kind of app (eg - gmail, slack, documents, etc). "
---

Works similar to the upload endpoint but is specifically designed to upload multiple app sources (e.g., Gmail, Slack, Notion) in a single request for processing and indexing.
Each app upload is handled using specialized pipelines inside Cortex and can include various content types with rich metadata.

> **Recommended**: For optimal performance, limit each batch to a maximum of **20 app sources** per request. Send multiple batch requests with an interval of **1 second** between each request.
