Works similar to the upload endpoint but is specifically designed to upload multiple app sources (e.g., Gmail, Slack, Notion) in a single request for processing and indexing.
Each app upload is handled using specialized pipelines inside Cortex and can include various content types with rich metadata.

## App Source Processing Pipeline

When you upload app sources, each source goes through specialized processing pipelines tailored to the specific app type:

### 1. **Immediate Upload & App Detection**
- All app sources are immediately accepted and stored securely
- App type is automatically detected (Gmail, Slack, Notion, etc.)
- Each source is routed to its specialized processing pipeline
- You receive a confirmation response with individual `file_id`s for tracking

### 2. **App-Specific Processing Phase**
Each app source is processed using specialized pipelines:
- **Gmail**: Email parsing, thread reconstruction, attachment handling
- **Slack**: Message threading, channel context, user mentions
- **Notion**: Page hierarchy, block structure, database relationships
- **Documents**: Format-specific parsing (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- **Custom Apps**: Configurable parsing based on app metadata

### 3. **Content Extraction & Normalization**
- **Multi-format Support**: Text, HTML, CSV, Markdown, and file attachments
- **Context Preservation**: Maintaining app-specific context and relationships
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Extracting app-specific metadata and timestamps
- **Content Cleaning**: Normalizing content while preserving structure

### 4. **Intelligent Chunking**
- App-aware chunking strategies preserve context and relationships
- Thread-based chunking for Gmail and Slack conversations
- Hierarchical chunking for Notion pages and databases
- Metadata is preserved and associated with each chunk

### 5. **Embedding Generation**
- Each chunk is converted into high-dimensional vector embeddings
- Embeddings capture semantic meaning and app-specific context
- Vectors are optimized for similarity search and retrieval
- Cross-app relationship embeddings for related content

### 6. **Indexing & Database Updates**
- Embeddings are stored in our vector database for fast similarity search
- Full-text search indexes are created for keyword-based queries
- App-specific metadata is indexed for filtering and faceted search
- Cross-references are established between related app sources

### 7. **Quality Assurance**
- App-specific quality checks ensure processing accuracy
- Content validation verifies extracted text completeness
- Relationship validation ensures proper context preservation
- Embedding quality is assessed for optimal retrieval performance

<Note>
**Processing Time**: App sources are processed in parallel using specialized pipelines. Most sources are fully processed and searchable within 2-5 minutes. Complex sources with multiple attachments may take up to 10 minutes. You can check processing status using the individual document IDs returned in the response.
</Note>

> **Recommended**: For optimal performance, limit each batch to a maximum of **20 app sources** per request. Send multiple batch requests with an interval of **1 second** between each request.

> **File ID Management**: When you provide a `file_id` as a key in the `document_metadata` object, that specific ID will be used to identify your content. If no `file_id` is provided in the `document_metadata`, the system will automatically generate a unique identifier for you. This allows you to maintain consistent references to your content across your application while ensuring every piece of content has a unique identifier.

### **Duplicate File ID Behavior**

When you upload app sources with `file_id`s that already exist in your tenant:

- **Overwrite Behavior**: Each existing app source with a matching `file_id` will be **completely replaced** with the new source
- **Processing**: Each new app source will go through its specialized processing pipeline independently
- **Search Results**: Previous search results and embeddings from old app sources will be replaced with the new sources' content
- **Idempotency**: Uploading the same app sources with the same `file_id`s multiple times is safe and will result in the same final state

<Warning>
**Important**: When overwriting existing app sources, all previous chunks, embeddings, and search indexes associated with those `file_id`s will be permanently removed and replaced. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

**Example Success Response for Duplicate File IDs in App Upload:**
```json
{
  "message": "App sources uploaded successfully. Sources with existing file_ids have been overwritten.",
  "document_ids": ["gmail_123456", "slack_789012", "notion_345678", "drive_901234"],
  "overwritten_file_ids": ["gmail_123456", "slack_789012"],
  "status": "success"
}
```

## Attachments Field Structure

The `attachments` field allows you to include additional files, documents, or content alongside your main app source. Each attachment supports multiple content formats and can contain nested structures for complex documents.

### Attachment Object Structure

```json
{
  "attachments": [
    {
      "id": "unique_attachment_id",
      "url": "https://example.com/document.pdf",
      "title": "Document Title",
      "content_type": "application/pdf",
      "content_url": "https://api.example.com/content/123",
      "misc": {
        "custom_field": "value"
      },
      "content": {
        "text": "Plain text content",
        "html_base64": "base64_encoded_html",
        "csv_base64": "base64_encoded_csv",
        "markdown": "# Markdown content",
        "files": [{"name": "file.pdf", "data": "base64_data"}],
        "layout": [{"type": "section", "content": "..."}]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### When to Use Each Field

**Core Identification Fields:**
- `id` (optional): Unique identifier for the attachment. If not provided, system generates one automatically.
- `title` (optional): Human-readable name for the attachment.
- `url` (optional): External URL where the attachment can be accessed.
- `content_type` (optional): MIME type of the attachment (e.g., "application/pdf", "text/plain").
- `content_url` (optional): API endpoint URL for retrieving attachment content.

**Content Storage Fields:**
Use these fields to store different types of content directly in the attachment:

- `content.text`: Use for plain text content. Best for simple text documents, notes, or extracted text from other formats.
- `content.html_base64`: Use for HTML content encoded in base64. Ideal for web pages, rich text documents, or formatted content that needs to preserve HTML structure.
- `content.csv_base64`: Use for CSV data encoded in base64. Perfect for tabular data, spreadsheets, or structured data exports.
- `content.markdown`: Use for Markdown-formatted content. Great for documentation, README files, or any content that uses Markdown syntax.
- `content.files`: Use for binary file attachments as an array of file objects. Each file object should contain at least a `name` and `data` field (base64 encoded).
- `content.layout`: Use for structured document layouts as an array of layout objects. Useful for complex documents with sections, headers, or custom formatting.

**Metadata Field:**
- `misc` (optional): Dictionary for storing custom metadata, additional properties, or app-specific information about the attachment.

### Content Format Guidelines

**For Text Content:**
```json
{
  "content": {
    "text": "This is plain text content that will be processed and indexed."
  }
}
```

**For HTML Content:**
```json
{
  "content": {
    "html_base64": "PGgxPkhlbGxvIFdvcmxkPC9oMT4="
  }
}
```

**For CSV Data:**
```json
{
  "content": {
    "csv_base64": "TmFtZSxBbW91bnQKSm9obiwxMDAKSmFuZSwyMDA="
  }
}
```

**For Markdown:**
```json
{
  "content": {
    "markdown": "# Document Title\n\nThis is **markdown** content with formatting."
  }
}
```

**For File Attachments:**
```json
{
  "content": {
    "files": [
      {
        "name": "document.pdf",
        "data": "JVBERi0xLjQKJcfsj6IKNSAwIG9iago8PAovVHlwZSAvUGFnZQovUGFyZW50IDMgMCBSCi9NZWRpYUJveCBbMCAwIDU5NSA4NDJdCi9SZXNvdXJjZXMgPDwKL0ZvbnQgPDwKL0YxIDIgMCBSCj4+Cj4+Ci9Db250ZW50cyA0IDAgUgo+PgplbmRvYmoK..."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Best Practices

1. **Choose the Right Format**: Use the content field that best matches your data type for optimal processing.
2. **Base64 Encoding**: Always encode binary data (HTML, CSV, files) in base64 format.
3. **File Size Limits**: Keep individual attachments under 10MB for optimal processing performance.
4. **Metadata Usage**: Use the `misc` field to store app-specific metadata that might be useful for filtering or organization.
5. **Content Type Specification**: Always specify `content_type` when possible to help with proper content processing.
