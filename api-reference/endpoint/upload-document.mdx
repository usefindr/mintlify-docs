Upload a document to your tenant's knowledge base. The document will be processed, chunked, and indexed for search and retrieval.

## Document Processing Pipeline

When you upload a document, it goes through a comprehensive processing pipeline designed to make your content searchable and retrievable:

### 1. **Immediate Upload & Queue**
- Your document is immediately accepted and stored securely
- It's added to our processing queue for background processing
- You receive a confirmation response with a `document_id` for tracking

### 2. **Processing Phase**
Our system automatically handles:
- **Content Extraction**: Extracting text from various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
- **Document Parsing**: Understanding document structure, headers, and formatting
- **Text Cleaning**: Removing formatting artifacts and normalizing content

### 3. **Intelligent Chunking**
- Documents are split into semantically meaningful chunks
- Chunk size is optimized for both context preservation and search accuracy
- Overlapping boundaries ensure no information is lost between chunks
- Metadata is preserved and associated with each chunk

### 4. **Embedding Generation**
- Each chunk is converted into high-dimensional vector embeddings
- Embeddings capture semantic meaning and context
- Vectors are optimized for similarity search and retrieval

### 5. **Indexing & Database Updates**
- Embeddings are stored in our vector database for fast similarity search
- Full-text search indexes are created for keyword-based queries
- Metadata is indexed for filtering and faceted search
- Cross-references are established for related documents

### 6. **Quality Assurance**
- Automated quality checks ensure processing accuracy
- Content validation verifies extracted text completeness
- Embedding quality is assessed for optimal retrieval performance

<Note>
**Processing Time**: Most documents are fully processed and searchable within 1-5 minutes. Larger documents (100+ pages) may take up to 15 minutes. You can check processing status using the document ID returned in the response.
</Note>

<Note>
**Default Sub-Tenant Behavior**: If you don't specify a `sub_tenant_id`, the document will be uploaded to the default sub-tenant created when your tenant was set up. This is perfect for organization-wide documents that should be accessible across all departments.
</Note>

> **File ID Management**: When you provide a `file_id` as a key in the `document_metadata` object, that specific ID will be used to identify your content. If no `file_id` is provided in the `document_metadata`, the system will automatically generate a unique identifier for you. This allows you to maintain consistent references to your content across your application while ensuring every piece of content has a unique identifier.

## Processing Status & Monitoring

After uploading, you can monitor your document's processing status:

### **Immediate Response**
Upon successful upload, you'll receive:
```json
{
  "message": "Document uploaded successfully",
  "document_id": "doc_123456"
}
```

### **Processing States**
Your document will progress through these states:
- **`queued`**: Document is in the processing queue, waiting to be processed
- **`in_progress`**: Document is actively being processed (includes content extraction, chunking, embedding generation, and indexing)
- **`success`**: Document is fully processed and searchable
- **`errored`**: Processing encountered an error (rare occurrence)

<Info>
**In-Progress Details**: While the status shows `in_progress`, the system is actually performing multiple steps: content extraction, document parsing, intelligent chunking, embedding generation, and database indexing. These happen sequentially but are all part of the single `in_progress` state.
</Info>

### **When Your Document is Ready**
Once processing is complete, your document will be:
- ✅ **Searchable** via semantic search and Q&A endpoints
- ✅ **Retrievable** through our retrieval APIs
- ✅ **Available** for AI-powered applications
- ✅ **Indexed** for fast query performance

<Warning>
**Important**: Don't attempt to search or retrieve your document immediately after upload. Wait for processing to complete (typically 1-5 minutes) to ensure optimal results.
</Warning>


## Best Practices

### **Document Preparation**
- **File Formats**: We support PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, and other common formats
- **File Size**: Documents up to 50MB are processed efficiently
- **Content Quality**: Clear, well-structured documents produce better embeddings
- **Metadata**: Include rich metadata for better filtering and organization

### **Processing Optimization**
- **Batch Uploads**: For multiple documents, consider using our batch upload endpoint
- **Metadata Consistency**: Use consistent metadata schemas across your organization
- **File Naming**: Descriptive filenames help with document identification

### **Troubleshooting**

**Document Not Appearing in Search?**
- Wait 5-10 minutes for processing to complete
- Check if the document status is `errored` (rare occurrence)
- Verify your search query and filters

**Slow Processing?**
- Large documents (100+ pages) take longer to process
- Complex formatting may require additional processing time
- High system load may temporarily slow processing

**Processing Failures?**
- If status shows `errored`, ensure your document isn't corrupted or password-protected
- Check that the file format is supported
- Verify your API key has sufficient permissions
