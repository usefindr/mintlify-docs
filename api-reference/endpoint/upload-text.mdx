### Sample Request
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.usecortex.ai/upload/upload_text?tenant_id=tenant_1234&sub_tenant_id=sub_tenant_4567' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "content": "<string>",
  "tenant_metadata": {},
  "document_metadata": {}
}'
  ```


Upload text content directly to your tenant's knowledge base. The text will be processed, chunked, and indexed for search and retrieval.

## Text Processing Pipeline

When you upload text content, it goes through a streamlined processing pipeline optimized for direct text input:

### 1. **Immediate Upload & Queue**
- Your text content is immediately accepted and stored securely
- It's added to our processing queue for background processing
- You receive a confirmation response with a `file_id` for tracking

### 2. **Text Processing Phase**
Our system automatically handles:
- **Content Validation**: Ensuring text content is properly formatted and accessible
- **Format Detection**: Identifying markdown, plain text, or structured content
- **Text Normalization**: Cleaning and standardizing text formatting

### 3. **Intelligent Chunking**
- Text is split into semantically meaningful chunks
- Chunk size is optimized for both context preservation and search accuracy
- Overlapping boundaries ensure no information is lost between chunks
- Metadata is preserved and associated with each chunk

### 4. **Embedding Generation**
- Each chunk is converted into high-dimensional vector embeddings
- Embeddings capture semantic meaning and context
- Vectors are optimized for similarity search and retrieval

### 5. **Indexing & Database Updates**
- Embeddings are stored in our vector database for fast similarity search
- Full-text search indexes are created for keyword-based queries
- Metadata is indexed for filtering and faceted search
- Cross-references are established for related content

### 6. **Quality Assurance**
- Automated quality checks ensure processing accuracy
- Content validation verifies text completeness
- Embedding quality is assessed for optimal retrieval performance

<Note>
**Processing Time**: Text content is typically processed and searchable within 1-3 minutes. Large text blocks (10,000+ words) may take up to 5 minutes. You can check processing status using the document ID returned in the response.
</Note>

<Note>
**Default Sub-Tenant Behavior**: If you don't specify a `sub_tenant_id`, the text content will be uploaded to the default sub-tenant created when your tenant was set up. This is perfect for organization-wide content that should be accessible across all departments.
</Note>

> **File ID Management**: When you provide a `file_id` as a key in the `document_metadata` object, that specific ID will be used to identify your content. If no `file_id` is provided in the `document_metadata`, the system will automatically generate a unique identifier for you. This allows you to maintain consistent references to your content across your application while ensuring every piece of content has a unique identifier.

### **Duplicate File ID Behavior**

When you upload text content with a `file_id` that already exists in your tenant:

- **Overwrite Behavior**: The existing text content with the same `file_id` will be **completely replaced** with the new content
- **Processing**: The new text content will go through the full processing pipeline (validation, chunking, embedding generation, indexing)
- **Search Results**: Previous search results and embeddings from the old content will be replaced with the new content
- **Idempotency**: Uploading the same text content with the same `file_id` multiple times is safe and will result in the same final state

<Warning>
**Important**: When overwriting existing text content, all previous chunks, embeddings, and search indexes associated with that `file_id` will be permanently removed and replaced. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

**Example Success Response for Duplicate File ID:**
```json
{
  "message": "Text content uploaded successfully. Existing content with file_id 'text_123456' has been overwritten.",
  "file_id": "text_123456",
  "status": "success"
}
```

## Processing Status & Monitoring

After uploading, you can monitor your text content's processing status:

### **Immediate Response**
Upon successful upload, you'll receive:
```json
{
  "message": "Text content uploaded successfully",
  "file_id": "doc_123456"
}
```

### **Processing States**
Your text content will progress through these states:
- **`queued`**: Text content is in the processing queue, waiting to be processed
- **`in_progress`**: Text content is actively being processed (includes validation, chunking, embedding generation, and indexing)
- **`success`**: Text content is fully processed and searchable
- **`errored`**: Processing encountered an error (rare occurrence)

<Info>
**In-Progress Details**: While the status shows `in_progress`, the system is actually performing multiple steps: content validation, format detection, intelligent chunking, embedding generation, and database indexing. These happen sequentially but are all part of the single `in_progress` state.
</Info>

### **When Your Text is Ready**
Once processing is complete, your text content will be:
- ✅ **Searchable** via semantic search and Q&A endpoints
- ✅ **Retrievable** through our retrieval APIs
- ✅ **Available** for AI-powered applications
- ✅ **Indexed** for fast query performance

<Warning>
**Important**: Don't attempt to search or retrieve your text content immediately after upload. Wait for processing to complete (typically 1-3 minutes) to ensure optimal results.
</Warning>

## Error Responses

All endpoints return consistent error responses following the standard format. For detailed error information, see our [Error Responses](/api-reference/error-responses) documentation.
