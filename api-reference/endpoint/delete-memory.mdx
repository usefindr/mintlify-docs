## Overview

The Delete User Memory endpoint allows you to remove specific memories from a user's memory profile. This is useful for maintaining data quality, removing outdated information, or giving users control over their stored personal data.

## Functionality

- **Targeted Deletion**: Removes a specific memory using its unique memory ID
- **User Context Validation**: Ensures the memory belongs to the authenticated user
- **Immediate Removal**: Permanently deletes the memory from the vector store
- **Confirmation Response**: Returns clear success/failure status for the deletion operation
- **Tenant Isolation**: Operates within the specified tenant/sub-tenant context

## Use Cases

- **Data Cleanup**: Remove outdated or incorrect memories
- **Privacy Compliance**: Allow users to delete their personal data
- **Memory Management**: Maintain high-quality memory profiles by removing irrelevant information
- **Error Correction**: Delete memories that were added incorrectly
- **User Control**: Give users the ability to manage their own memory data


## Important Notes

<Warning>
**Permanent Deletion**: Once a memory is deleted, it cannot be recovered. Make sure you have the correct memory ID before proceeding with deletion.
</Warning>

<Note>
**Memory ID Source**: Memory IDs (source_id) can be obtained from the [List User Memories](/api-reference/endpoint/list-user-memories) endpoint or from the response of [Add User Memory](/api-reference/endpoint/add-user-memory) and [Generate User Memory](/api-reference/endpoint/generate-user-memory) endpoints.
</Note>

<Info>
**Best Practices**:
- Always verify the memory content before deletion using the List endpoint
- Consider implementing user confirmation for memory deletion
- Log deletion activities for audit purposes
- Provide users with a way to review their memories before deletion
</Info>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: For bulk memory management, you can combine this API with the List API to create a memory management interface that allows users to review and selectively delete their memories.
