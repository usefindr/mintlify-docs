## Overview

The Delete User Memory endpoint allows you to remove specific memories from a user's memory profile. This is useful for maintaining data quality, removing outdated information, or giving users control over their stored personal data.

## Functionality

- **Targeted Deletion**: Removes a specific memory using its unique memory ID
- **User Context Validation**: Ensures the memory belongs to the authenticated user
- **Immediate Removal**: Permanently deletes the memory from the vector store
- **Confirmation Response**: Returns clear success/failure status for the deletion operation
- **Tenant Isolation**: Operates within the specified tenant/sub-tenant context

## Use Cases

- **Data Cleanup**: Remove outdated or incorrect memories
- **Privacy Compliance**: Allow users to delete their personal data
- **Memory Management**: Maintain high-quality memory profiles by removing irrelevant information
- **Error Correction**: Delete memories that were added incorrectly
- **User Control**: Give users the ability to manage their own memory data

### Finding Memory IDs

To delete a memory, you first need to find its ID using the [List User Memories](/api-reference/endpoint/list-user-memories) endpoint:

```bash
# First, list all memories to find the ID
curl -X GET "https://api.cortex.com/user_memory/list_user_memories?tenant_id=company_123&sub_tenant_id=marketing_team" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"

# Response will include source_id for each memory
{
  "success": true,
  "user_memories": [
    {
      "source_id": "mem_001_abc123",  # This is the memory_id to use
      "source_content": "User prefers detailed technical explanations..."
    }
  ]
}

# Then delete using the source_id
curl -X DELETE "https://api.cortex.com/user_memory/delete_user_memory?tenant_id=company_123&sub_tenant_id=marketing_team&memory_id=mem_001_abc123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Important Notes

<Warning>
**Permanent Deletion**: Once a memory is deleted, it cannot be recovered. Make sure you have the correct memory ID before proceeding with deletion.
</Warning>

<Note>
**Memory ID Source**: Memory IDs (source_id) can be obtained from the [List User Memories](/api-reference/endpoint/list-user-memories) endpoint or from the response of [Add User Memory](/api-reference/endpoint/add-user-memory) and [Generate User Memory](/api-reference/endpoint/generate-user-memory) endpoints.
</Note>

<Info>
**Best Practices**:
- Always verify the memory content before deletion using the List endpoint
- Consider implementing user confirmation for memory deletion
- Log deletion activities for audit purposes
- Provide users with a way to review their memories before deletion
</Info>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: For bulk memory management, you can combine this endpoint with the List endpoint to create a memory management interface that allows users to review and selectively delete their memories.
