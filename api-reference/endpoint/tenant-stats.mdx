### Sample Request
<TryIt />
```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.usecortex.ai/tenant/stats?tenant_id=tenant_1234&sub_tenant_id=sub_tenant_4567' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
  ```
Retrieve statistics for a specific tenant or sub-tenant. This endpoint provides insights into organizational data including object count, vector dimensions, and tenant information within Cortex's multi-tenant architecture.


### Query Parameters
- **tenant_id**: Required string - Primary organizational identifier (e.g., enterprise client, company) for multi-tenant data isolation
- **sub_tenant_id**: Optional string - Secondary organizational identifier (e.g., department, team, project) within a tenant for hierarchical data organization; defaults to tenant_id if not provided

### Multi-Tenant Context
This endpoint leverages Cortex's hierarchical tenant system where:
- **Tenant Level**: Stats for an entire organization (e.g., "acme_corp")
- **Sub-Tenant Level**: Stats for specific departments or teams within an organization (e.g., "engineering" within "acme_corp")
- **Data Isolation**: All statistics are completely isolated per tenant/sub-tenant combination

### Response Details
- **object_count**: Number of objects/embeddings stored for the tenant
- **vector_dimension**: Dimension size of the embedding vectors for this tenant
- **tenant_name**: The name/identifier of the tenant


## Use Cases

This endpoint is useful for:
- **Monitoring**: Track the number of embeddings stored for a tenant or department
- **Validation**: Verify vector dimensions before uploading new embeddings to ensure compatibility
- **Analytics**: Generate usage reports and statistics for billing, compliance, or optimization
- **Capacity Planning**: Understand storage requirements and usage patterns across organizations
- **Multi-Tenant Management**: Monitor data distribution across enterprise clients and their departments
- **Department Insights**: Compare usage patterns between different teams within the same organization

### Example Scenarios
- **Enterprise Dashboard**: `tenant_id="acme_corp"` to see total company usage
- **Department Analytics**: `tenant_id="acme_corp", sub_tenant_id="engineering"` for team-specific stats
- **Client Reporting**: Generate individual reports for each enterprise client in your B2B platform
