Delete a specific sub-tenant from a given tenant after validating it's not the primary/default sub-tenant.

<Warning>
**Important**: You cannot delete the default sub-tenant. The default sub-tenant is automatically created when a tenant is created and serves as the organization-wide workspace. Attempting to delete it will result in a 400 Bad Request error.
</Warning>

## Understanding Sub-Tenant Deletion

### What Gets Deleted
When you delete a sub-tenant, the following occurs:
- **All Data Removal**: All documents, embeddings, and metadata associated with the sub-tenant are permanently deleted
- **Complete Cleanup**: The sub-tenant ID is removed from the tenant's sub-tenant list
- **Irreversible Action**: This operation cannot be undone - all data is permanently lost

### What Cannot Be Deleted
- **Default Sub-Tenant**: The automatically created default sub-tenant cannot be deleted
- **Primary Tenant**: You cannot delete the main tenant itself using this API

<Note>
**Default Sub-Tenant Protection**: Cortex automatically protects the default sub-tenant from deletion to ensure your organization always has a primary workspace. If you need to clean up the default sub-tenant, you would need to delete and recreate the entire tenant.
</Note>

## Query Parameters

- **tenant_id**: Required string - The primary tenant identifier (e.g., your organization ID)
- **sub_tenant_id**: Required string - The sub-tenant identifier to delete (e.g., department or team name)

## Use Cases

### **Department Restructuring**
- **Team Consolidation**: Merge departments by deleting unused sub-tenants
- **Organizational Changes**: Remove sub-tenants for departments that no longer exist
- **Cleanup**: Remove test or temporary sub-tenants created during development

### **Data Management**
- **Compliance**: Remove sub-tenants containing sensitive data that's no longer needed
- **Storage Optimization**: Delete sub-tenants with outdated or irrelevant content
- **Privacy**: Remove sub-tenants for users who have left the organization

### **Application Lifecycle**
- **Project Cleanup**: Remove sub-tenants for completed projects
- **Client Management**: Delete sub-tenants for clients who have ended their contracts
- **Testing**: Clean up test sub-tenants after development phases

## Example Requests

### Delete a Department Sub-Tenant
```bash
DELETE /delete_sub_tenant?tenant_id=acme_corp&sub_tenant_id=engineering
```

### Delete a User Sub-Tenant (B2C)
```bash
DELETE /delete_sub_tenant?tenant_id=my_app&sub_tenant_id=user_12345
```

### Delete a Project Sub-Tenant
```bash
DELETE /delete_sub_tenant?tenant_id=consulting_firm&sub_tenant_id=project_alpha
```

## Sample Response

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "tenant_id": "acme_corp",
  "sub_tenant_id": "engineering",
  "message": "Sub-tenant 'engineering' deleted successfully from tenant 'acme_corp'"
}
```

## Error Responses

All endpoints return consistent error responses following the standard format. For detailed error information, see our [Error Responses](/api-reference/error-responses) documentation.

## Best Practices

### **Before Deletion**
1. **Verify Sub-Tenant**: Use the [List Sub-Tenant IDs](/api-reference/endpoint/list-sub-tenant-ids) endpoint to confirm the sub-tenant exists
2. **Backup Important Data**: Export any critical data before deletion
3. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure no active integrations depend on the sub-tenant

### **After Deletion**
1. **Update Applications**: Remove references to the deleted sub-tenant from your applications
2. **Notify Users**: Inform relevant users that the sub-tenant workspace is no longer available
3. **Update Documentation**: Remove the sub-tenant from any internal documentation

### **Safety Measures**
- **Test in Development**: Always test sub-tenant deletion in a development environment first
- **Gradual Rollout**: Consider a phased approach for large-scale sub-tenant cleanup
- **Audit Trail**: Keep records of which sub-tenants were deleted and when

<Info>
**Recovery**: Once a sub-tenant is deleted, it cannot be recovered. The sub-tenant ID can be reused by creating new content with the same ID, but all previous data will be lost.
</Info>

<Warning>
**Impact on Active Users**: Ensure no users are actively working with data in the sub-tenant before deletion, as this will result in immediate data loss and potential application errors.
