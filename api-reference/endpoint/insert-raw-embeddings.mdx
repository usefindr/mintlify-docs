Upload pre-computed embedding vectors directly to your tenant's knowledge base. This is useful when you have your own embedding model or want to use embeddings from external sources.

## Embedding Processing Pipeline

When you upload pre-computed embeddings, they go through a streamlined processing pipeline optimized for vector data:

### 1. **Immediate Upload & Validation**
- Your embedding vectors are immediately accepted and validated
- Dimensional consistency is checked across all vectors
- Format validation ensures proper numeric array structure
- You receive a confirmation response with a `file_id` for tracking

### 2. **Vector Processing Phase**
Our system automatically handles:
- **Dimensional Validation**: Ensuring all vectors have consistent dimensions
- **Data Type Normalization**: Converting to optimal numeric formats
- **Vector Quality Assessment**: Checking for valid numeric ranges and patterns
- **Batch ID Generation**: Creating unique chunk IDs for each embedding vector

### 3. **Chunk ID Assignment**
- Each embedding vector receives a unique chunk ID in format `{batch_id}_{index}`
- These IDs serve as references for retrieval and linking to original content
- Example: `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]` becomes `CortexEmbeddings123_0`
- You can use these chunk IDs to link back to your original text content

### 4. **Direct Indexing**
- Embeddings are directly stored in our vector database (no embedding generation needed)
- Full-text search indexes are created for associated metadata
- Metadata is indexed for filtering and faceted search
- Cross-references are established for related embedding batches

### 5. **Quality Assurance**
- Automated quality checks ensure vector integrity
- Dimensional consistency validation across the tenant
- Vector range and format validation
- Database storage verification

<Note>
**Processing Time**: Pre-computed embeddings are typically processed and searchable within 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Large embedding batches (1000+ vectors) may take up to 5 minutes. You can check processing status using the document ID returned in the response.
</Note>

<Note>
**Default Sub-Tenant Behavior**: If you don't specify a `sub_tenant_id`, the embeddings will be uploaded to the default sub-tenant created when your tenant was set up. This is perfect for organization-wide embeddings that should be accessible across all departments.
</Note>

### Requirements
- **Maximum dimensions**: 2000 rows × 3024 columns; i.e, 2000 chunks with the dimensions, not more than 3024
- **Format**: 2D array of numeric values (int or float)
- **Consistency**: All embedding vectors must have the same dimension
- **Content**: Embeddings array cannot be empty
- **Processing**: Generates unique chunk IDs in format `{batch_id}_{index} for each row`. 
  - Consider them as references of that particular embeddings vector. You will get back these `chunk_ids`, when you query something.
  - In the example on your right, the reference to `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]` is `CortexEmbeddings123_0`
  - You can use these chunk IDs to link the original text which is being embedded
- **Dimensional consistency per tenant**: All embedding vectors within a tenant must have identical dimensions. Different dimensional vectors require separate tenants

> **File ID Management**: When you provide a `file_id` as a key in the `document_metadata` object, that specific ID will be used to identify your content. If no `file_id` is provided in the `document_metadata`, the system will automatically generate a unique identifier for you. This allows you to maintain consistent references to your content across your application while ensuring every piece of content has a unique identifier.

### **Duplicate File ID Behavior**

When you upload embeddings with a `file_id` that already exists in your tenant:

- **Overwrite Behavior**: The existing embeddings with the same `file_id` will be **completely replaced** with the new embeddings
- **Processing**: The new embeddings will go through validation and direct indexing (no embedding generation needed)
- **Search Results**: Previous search results and vector data from the old embeddings will be replaced with the new embeddings
- **Idempotency**: Uploading the same embeddings with the same `file_id` multiple times is safe and will result in the same final state

<Warning>
**Important**: When overwriting existing embeddings, all previous vector data, chunk IDs, and search indexes associated with that `file_id` will be permanently removed and replaced. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

**Example Success Response for Duplicate File ID:**
```json
{
  "message": "Embeddings uploaded successfully. Existing embeddings with file_id 'emb_123456' have been overwritten.",
  "file_id": "emb_123456",
  "status": "success"
}
```


## Error Responses

All endpoints return consistent error responses following the standard format. For detailed error information, see our [Error Responses](/api-reference/error-responses) documentation.
