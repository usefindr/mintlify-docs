## Overview

The Retrieve User Memory endpoint performs semantic search through a user's stored memories to find the most relevant information based on a query. This is the primary endpoint for accessing user memories in your AI applications, enabling context-aware responses and personalized interactions.

## Functionality

- **Semantic Search**: Uses advanced vector search to find memories that are semantically similar to your query
- **Relevance Ranking**: Returns memories ranked by relevance to the search query
- **Configurable Results**: Control the number of memories returned with the `max_count` parameter
- **Intelligent Selection**: When `max_count` is set to 0, Cortex intelligently selects the best memories based on relevance and context
- **Context-Aware**: Finds memories that are contextually relevant, not just keyword matches

## How Semantic Search Works

Unlike traditional keyword search, semantic search understands the meaning and context of your query. For example:
- Query: "authentication preferences" 
- Will find memories about: "JWT tokens", "login methods", "security settings", etc.
- Even if the exact words don't match

## Use Cases

- **Context Retrieval**: Get relevant user context before generating AI responses
- **Personalization**: Find user preferences and past interactions for tailored experiences
- **Memory-Based Chat**: Enable AI to reference past conversations and user history
- **Recommendation Systems**: Use user memories to provide personalized recommendations
- **Customer Support**: Access user history and preferences for better support


### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "user_memories": [
    {
      "source_id": "mem_001_abc123",
      "source_content": "User prefers JWT tokens over session-based authentication for microservices"
    },
    {
      "source_id": "mem_002_def456", 
      "source_content": "User values stateless authentication approaches"
    },
    {
      "source_id": "mem_003_ghi789",
      "source_content": "User understands the importance of rate limiting for security"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Advanced Usage: Context-Aware AI Response

```bash
# First, retrieve relevant memories
curl -X POST "https://api.cortex.com/user_memory/retrieve_user_memory?tenant_id=company_123&sub_tenant_id=product_team&max_count=3" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "user onboarding feedback"
  }'

# Then use these memories to generate a personalized response
```

### Different Query Examples

```bash
# Find communication preferences
curl -X POST "https://api.cortex.com/user_memory/retrieve_user_memory?tenant_id=company_123&sub_tenant_id=marketing_team&max_count=2" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "communication style preferences"
  }'

# Find technical expertise areas  
curl -X POST "https://api.cortex.com/user_memory/retrieve_user_memory?tenant_id=company_123&sub_tenant_id=engineering_team&max_count=5" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "technical skills and experience"
  }'

# Find project-related memories
curl -X POST "https://api.cortex.com/user_memory/retrieve_user_memory?tenant_id=company_123&sub_tenant_id=product_team&max_count=3" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "current project work"
  }'

### Intelligent Selection (max_count=0)

When you want Cortex to intelligently select the most relevant memories without specifying a count:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.cortex.com/user_memory/retrieve_user_memory?tenant_id=company_123&sub_tenant_id=engineering_team&max_count=0" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "authentication preferences"
  }'
```

With `max_count=0`, Cortex will analyze all available memories and return only the most relevant ones based on semantic similarity and contextual relevance, automatically determining the optimal number of memories to return.

## Important Notes

<Warning>
**Automatic Tenant Provisioning**: If you receive an error stating "Tenant-id/sub-tenant-id combination either does not exist or is not provisioned for user memory", this means the tenant/sub-tenant combination hasn't been set up for user memory functionality yet. This will be automatically provisioned when you add or generate your first user memory for this combination.
</Warning>

<Note>
**Empty Results**: If no relevant memories are found, the endpoint returns an empty array. This is normal for new users or when searching for topics not covered in existing memories.
</Note>

<Info>
**Query Optimization**: 
- Be specific about the type of information you're looking for
- Consider using synonyms or related terms if initial queries don't return results
- Shorter, focused queries often work better than long, complex ones
</Info>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: This endpoint is most powerful when used in combination with other user memory endpoints. Use [Generate User Memory](/api-reference/endpoint/generate-user-memory) to create memories from user interactions, then use this endpoint to retrieve relevant context for future interactions.
