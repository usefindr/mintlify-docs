Upload multiple documents simultaneously to your tenant's knowledge base. All documents will be processed, chunked, and indexed for search and retrieval.

## Batch Processing Pipeline

When you upload multiple documents, each document goes through our comprehensive processing pipeline in parallel:

### 1. **Immediate Upload & Queue**
- All documents are immediately accepted and stored securely
- Each document is added to our processing queue for background processing
- You receive a confirmation response with individual `document_id`s for tracking each file

### 2. **Parallel Processing Phase**
Each document is processed independently with:
- **Content Extraction**: Extracting text from various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
- **Document Parsing**: Understanding document structure, headers, and formatting
- **Text Cleaning**: Removing formatting artifacts and normalizing content

### 3. **Intelligent Chunking**
- Each document is split into semantically meaningful chunks
- Chunk size is optimized for both context preservation and search accuracy
- Overlapping boundaries ensure no information is lost between chunks
- Metadata is preserved and associated with each chunk

### 4. **Embedding Generation**
- Each chunk is converted into high-dimensional vector embeddings
- Embeddings capture semantic meaning and context
- Vectors are optimized for similarity search and retrieval

### 5. **Indexing & Database Updates**
- Embeddings are stored in our vector database for fast similarity search
- Full-text search indexes are created for keyword-based queries
- Metadata is indexed for filtering and faceted search
- Cross-references are established between related documents

### 6. **Quality Assurance**
- Automated quality checks ensure processing accuracy for each document
- Content validation verifies extracted text completeness
- Embedding quality is assessed for optimal retrieval performance

<Note>
**Processing Time**: Batch uploads are processed in parallel. Most documents are fully processed and searchable within 2-5 minutes. Larger documents (100+ pages) may take up to 15 minutes. You can check processing status using the individual document IDs returned in the response.
</Note>

<Note>
**Default Sub-Tenant Behavior**: If you don't specify a `sub_tenant_id`, all documents will be uploaded to the default sub-tenant created when your tenant was set up. This is perfect for organization-wide document batches that should be accessible across all departments.
</Note>

> **Recommended**: For optimal performance, limit each batch to a maximum of **20 sources** per request. Send multiple batch requests with an interval of **1 second** between each request.

> **File ID Management**: When you provide a `file_id` as a key in the `document_metadata` object, that specific ID will be used to identify your content. If no `file_id` is provided in the `document_metadata`, the system will automatically generate a unique identifier for you. This allows you to maintain consistent references to your content across your application while ensuring every piece of content has a unique identifier.
