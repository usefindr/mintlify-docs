</Note>

## Important Notes

<Warning>
**Memory Privacy**: This endpoint returns all memories for the authenticated user. Ensure proper access controls are in place to prevent unauthorized access to user memory data.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Memory IDs**: Each memory has a unique `source_id` that can be used with the [Delete User Memory](/api-reference/endpoint/delete-user-memory) endpoint to remove specific memories.
</Info>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: Use this endpoint in combination with [Retrieve User Memory](/api-reference/endpoint/retrieve-user-memory) to first search for relevant memories, then list all memories to get the complete context.
</Tip>
