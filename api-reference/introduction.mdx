Welcome to the Cortex SDK API Reference. This section documents every available endpoint and how to interact with them to power AI apps and agents with intelligent memory and retrieval.

### **Upload APIs**

Send knowledge into Cortex. Upload documents, batch files, and scrape webpages.

- `/upload/upload_document`
- `/upload/batch_upload`
- `/upload/scrape_webpage`

### **Search API**

Ask questions. Retrieve personalized answers from memory and indexed sources.

- `/search/qna` â€” supports an optional `metadata` parameter to filter sources by `source_title` or `source_type`.

### **Listing APIs**

Browse what's in your Cortex memory or knowledge store.

- `/list/sources`
- `/list/sources_by_id`

### **Knowledge Management**

Manage knowledge entries, delete outdated or unwanted context.

- `/delete_memory`

### **Processing Verification**

Check if a file or page was successfully processed.

- `/upload/verify_processing`

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices

- Use **sub-tenants** to support multi-user isolation in B2B use cases.
- Leverage **metadata** (e.g., `source_title`, `source_type` in the QnA API) for fine-grained filtering and agentic retrieval.
- Tune **search_alpha** and **recency_bias** to control relevance.
- Enable **highlight_chunks** for chunk-level citations.
